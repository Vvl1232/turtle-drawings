# Turtle Graphics Art Projects
This repository contains several Python scripts utilizing the turtle module to create various graphical patterns and designs. Below are descriptions of each project included in this script.

Note: Each section of code should be run separately to see the respective outputs.

Hirst Painting
Inspired by the work of artist Damien Hirst, this script creates a dot painting using the Turtle graphics library. Each dot is randomly colored from a predefined list of colors. The painting is composed of rows and columns of these colorful dots.

Dashed Line
This script draws a dashed line. The turtle alternates between drawing a short segment and moving forward with the pen up.

Circle
This script draws a circle with a specified radius and color using the Turtle graphics library.

Shape Overlapping Pattern
This script draws overlapping geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, pentagons, etc., with the Turtle graphics library.

Random Walk
This script generates a random walk pattern with the turtle changing direction and color randomly at each step.

Spirograph
This script draws a spirograph pattern, which is a series of circles drawn in a circular path, creating a mesmerizing design.
